## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

If you get an error about StatePointer when using Lua, run `haxelib remove linc_luajit` into Command Prompt/PowerShell, then re-install linc_luajit.

If you want video support on your mod, simply do `haxelib install hxCodec` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

# Features

## Psych Engine Features

OS Engine is a fork of Psych Engine, so you can use almost every feature from Psych Engine in OS Engine!

## OS Engine Features

### Psych Engine mods compability
Yes, almost every mod for Psych Engine runs on OS Engine (But you need to convert icons to 450x150)

### Note Skins
OS Engine adds a note skins system! There's only Default and Circle skins by default.

### Showcase Mode
This feature hides HUD and enables botplay. So you can showcase any mod without any problems.

### Perfect!! Judgement
Adds Perfect!! Judgement. It's better than sick. Btw you can disable it in settings if you want.

### Custom Settings in Chart Editor.
Now you can enable character trails (Like in thorns or maybe mid fight masses). Or "Camera Follow Notes" like in 99% of mods atm (it's buggy).

### Literally Useless Exit Game State
Now you can press ESC at title state. And game will ask you do you want to close game or no

### Bit Changed Main Menu State

### Winning icons 
Instead of 2 icons, there'll be three icons (losing, normal, winning). So you need icon file 450x150, or it won't work

*thanks Cooljer for remaking original fnf icons*

### Shaders
Returned shaders from old psych engine versions. Now you can make your bambi mods.

### Custom Title State
Bit changed Title State. Now it looks way more better.
